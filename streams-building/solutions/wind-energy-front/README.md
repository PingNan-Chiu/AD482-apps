# Patternfly Seed

Patternfly Seed is an open source build scaffolding utility for web apps. The primary purpose of this project is to give developers a jump start when creating new projects that will use patternfly. A secondary purpose of this project is to serve as a reference for how to configure various aspects of an application that uses patternfly, webpack, react, typescript, etc.

Out of the box you'll get an app layout with chrome (header/sidebar), routing, build pipeline, test suite, and some code quality tools. Basically, all the essentials.
